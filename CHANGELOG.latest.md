**RevenueCat Capacitor SDK v6** is here!! ðŸ˜»

This is the first release of this SDK after RevenueCat took over development. We have moved the plugin to:
```
@revenuecat/purchases-capacitor
```

This release updates the SDK to use BillingClient 5 in Android. This version of BillingClient brings an entire new subscription model which has resulted in large changes across the entire SDK.

Additionally, we have added a lot of new functionality previously not supported on this plugin.

  advantage of it in V6. This guide includes tips on product setup with the new model.
