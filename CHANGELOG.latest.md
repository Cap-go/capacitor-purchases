### New Features
* Support capacitor V6 (#295) via Toni Rico (@tonidero)

**Note:** This might break compatibility with some users using Capacitor V5 so you might need to update to Capacitor V6. This is required to upload new builds to the Play Store starging August 31st (since it adds compatibility with target version 34). This change was previously released as part of the 8.0.0-beta releases but it has been ported to version 7 of the SDK.
